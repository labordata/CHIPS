+ The lead case will have 001 in Suffix Field and 1 in Situation
+ Following cases will have 002 through 999 in Suffix Field and 4 in Situation Field
+ Companion Case
+ An individual of some other party filed similar charges against an employer and a union resulting in a CA and CB case;
"+ CC and CD charges (or any combination of CB, CC, CD) are files against the same union."
"+ The Key case in this kind of Situation will always be the case with the lowest docket number of the lowest type (CA,CB,CC,CD,CE,CG,CP) with a suffix of 001"
+ The Key case in this kind of grouping of cases will have a 2 in Situation
"+ The Sub-Key in this kind of a group will be the next type (CB,CC,CD,CE,CG,CP) case with 001."
+ The Sub-Key (campanion case) will have a 3 in Situation
+  Suffixed Cases can be included in this type of group
